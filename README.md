# ParkinsonDiseaseDetection
Designed an innovative project centered on showcasing Ensemble Techniques in machine learning for accurate Parkinson's disease detection. The project incorporates diverse ensemble methods that combine multiple models to achieve precise predictions.

In addition to implementing ensemble techniques, the project also emphasizes the importance of data manipulation and dimensional reduction techniques. By carefully preprocessing the data and reducing its dimensionality, the project aims to enhance the overall accuracy of the models.

The impact of these data manipulation and dimensional reduction techniques is evident in the evaluation metric used, specifically the F1-score. Initially, the F1-score achieved a value of 87% without employing these techniques. However, through the application of data manipulation and dimensional reduction, the F1-score increased significantly to an impressive 94%.

The repository provides detailed documentation, code examples, and resources to facilitate understanding and implementation of ensemble techniques, data manipulation, and dimensional reduction methods. By exploring this repository, users can gain insights into how ensemble models can improve prediction accuracy and how to leverage data preprocessing techniques to optimize model performance.
